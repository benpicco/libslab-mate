This is a TO-DO file for turning libslab into a standalone library.
It used to be that libslab was a subdirectory of the mate-main-menu
module, and other users like mate-control-center would simply include
it as an svn:external.

However, with the move from Subversion to Git, and because libslab is
used by other projects anyway (like openSUSE's YaST), it is better to
have libslab as a "real" stand-alone library than as some chunk of
code that gets magically included in other projects.


=== Users of libslab ===

+ Remove the assumption in mate-control-center that libslab is an
  svn:external, and make it use libslab as a stand-alone library.
